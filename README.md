## arduino-pong

My 2017 high school's final year project. A portable 2-player pong console powered by Arduino in a custom made PCB and enclosure.

The repository includes:
*   The arduino program source code;
*   The schematics and PCB design (made with Fritzing);
*   The enclosuer's Autodesk Inventor Part file.
